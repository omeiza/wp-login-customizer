# wp-login-customizer
WP-login-customizer is a plugin built to help you customize the WordPress login page by taking advantage of [WordPress theme Customizer API](http://https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API). 

The Customizer is a framework for live-previewing any change to WordPress. It provides a simple and consistent interface for users to customize various aspects of their theme and their site, from colors and layouts to widgets, menus, and more. Themes and plugins alike can add custom options to the Customizer. The Customizer is the canonical way to add options to your theme.

## Why this Plugin was built
Sometimes we feel the need to change how the WP Login Page look like. The things we can change on the login page are:

1. The Background Color
2. The Background Image ( and it’s positioning )
3. The Logo Image (and it’s size)
4. The Logo Link URL
This plugin will help you make these changes right from your admin dashboard without writing a line of code.

## Usage
1. Download/clone this repository and copy it to your WordPress plugin folder.
2. Activate the plugin on your dashboard.
3. Click on the customizer(submenu of appearance) to change the customizer setting, the plugin logo settings and the logo background settings.

## Bonus
By default, clicking on the WP logo or the logo link on the WP-login page takes you to http://wordpress.org. This plugin ensures that it takes you to your website’s homepage.

## Support
Theme Customization API was added in Wordpress 3.4. This means that this plugin will only work on WordPress engine version 3.4 and above.
